                <p>
                    My name is Priyadharshini Chandrakanthan.

                <p>
                    I am student of Concordia University, who moved to Canada three years ago.
                    I live here with my sister and her family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am originally from India. I have two sisters and I am a proud auntie of my beautiful niece and
                    lovely
                    nephew.
                    I did my Bachelor degree in Holy Cross College in India. I basically came here to live with my
                    sister
                    and
                    also sharpen my career life.</p>
                <p> I have been doing my Bachelor degree, majoring in Accounting for the
                    past
                    three
                    years. I have a diploma in Human Resources Management. I am currently doing a diploma in Social
                    Media
                    Applications and Marketing.
                </p>
                <p>I am interested in Developing and Designing. I have been exploring all
                    my favourite course of studies not intentionally but I am confident that I will find my passionate
                    work
                    of field after completing this diploma.
